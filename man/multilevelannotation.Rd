\details{
Multistage clustering algorithm based on intensity profiles, 
retention time characteristics, mass defect, isotope/adduct
patterns and correlation with signals for metabolic
precursors and products. The algorithm uses high-resolution
mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with
common properties and publicly available chemical,
metabolic and environmental databases to assign
confidence levels to annotation results.  
}
\value{
The function generates output at each stage:
Stage 1 includes modules and retention time based clustering
of features without any annotation
Stage 2 includes  modules and retention time based
clustering of features along with simple m/z based
database matching
Stage 3 includes scores for annotations assigned in stage 2
Stages 4 and 5 include the confidence levels before and 
after redundancy (multiple matches) filtering, respectively
